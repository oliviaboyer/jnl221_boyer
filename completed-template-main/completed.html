			<h3>The Digital Divide</h3>

			<p>Education is an incredibly important aspect of the United States schooling system, but in 2020, the pillar was turned on its head with the spread of COVID-19. The pandemic caused many struggling school systems to be further exposed in their inequality in resources, specifically regarding the digital divide. <br>
<br>
The New Jersey School system is an especially interesting case study of need-based digital education, and the strains of consistent connection outside of the physical classroom. <br>
<br>
The digital divide is the disparity between those who have reliable access to the internet and computer, and those who don’t. According to Alex Smith, a teaching assistant from a school in Passaic County,  the pandemic sped up a digital transformation that was already beginning. <br>
<br>

“It’s accelerated the transition that was already happening,” Smith said, “As far as I can tell, now, most students and schools that I know of are now one to one (computer to student).” <br>
<br>
A compiled data analysis was performed, aiming to find the counties and districts that contribute the most to the New Jersey digital divide. While somewhat important, in the top and bottom school districts, the number of students was not related to the percentage points contributed to digital divide. <br>

	<h3>County Break-up</h3>
			<p>In the state of New Jersey, Bergen county is the best-ranked county for education and one of the wealthiest areas in the state. Despite the population, Bergen county contributes 0 percentage points to the 29% of NJ students who don’t have access to the internet. <br>
<br>
Conversely, nearly half of Mercer county students don’t have reliable internet access. The worst ranked school district, Trenton Public Schools, contributes 6 percentage points to the 29% of NJ students without reliable internet. <br>
<br>
Approximately ¾ of Trenton Public School students don’t have reliable internet access, meaning over 11,000 students aren’t able to access educational resources in a growing digital world.

			<h3>New Jersey Compared</h3>
			<p>While New Jersey is <a href="https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/education/2023/08/22/new-jersey-schools-rank-fourth-in-u-s-for-early-education/70643684007/">known</a> to have a quality education system, the distribution of wealth state-wide does not lead all schools to be equal. In the United States, <a href="https://www.ntia.gov/blog/2018/digital-divide-among-school-age-children-narrows-millions-still-lack-internet-connections#:~:text=Among%20children%20in%20offline%20households,with%20home%20Internet%20service%2C%20respectively.">7 million students</a> do not have internet access at home, about 20% of the school-age population. <br>
<br>
Many students without reliable internet access looked outside the home to be able to attend classes. In some areas, there were organizations trying to help. <br>
<br>
“The local (Passaic) Boys and Girls Club had to expand their after school program and ended up taking on the responsibility of holding a large number of students to work there.” Smith said. <br>
<br>
Of the population of students without internet access, NJ contributed only one percentage point to the national proportion, stacking up against other states.

<p> 
	There is more nuance to the digital divide than just access to internet and owning a computer. According to Smith, many students weren’t able to work from home due to their parents work schedules and couldn’t attend class along with an inability to advocate for themselves as to why they missed school. <br>

<br>
Additionally, there is a gap between the demand for technical knowledge and the reality of what teachers know. At the time, many lacked the know-how to communicate effectively with students and parents, making it even harder for students to excel academically.<br>
<br>
This system also puts students with learning disabilities and other conditions at further disadvantage. Without direct instruction and clear communication, students were marked badly without consideration of outside affects, said Smith. <br>

<h3>Moving Forward</h3>
<p> While COVID-19 was a push in the direction of digital education, it has many lasting effects on on-site schooling in the United States. Many schools have enacted online classes in place of snow days or sick days rather than make up assignments or days off. Not only does this shed light on the disparity between those with the internet and those who don’t, it also perpetuates the unhealthy concept of never taking a break. <br>
<br>
The New Jersey Department of Education has worked to aid in the digital gap, but with the rate and diversity of different school policies, it’s impossible to keep up with need in these districts, let alone in other states. According to Smith, in 2020 they were able to provide every student with a personal laptop, but they couldn’t provide consistent internet connection. <br>
<br>
New Jersey is not representative of the United States, it’s the best case scenario, meaning that the majority of schools are doing significantly worse and are less productive in their use of state funding to support students.
